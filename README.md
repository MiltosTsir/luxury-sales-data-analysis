# Luxury Sales Data Analysis (Excel Project)

## Objective
This project explores a **fictional luxury retail dataset** using **Microsoft Excel**.  
The goal is to understand sales trends, regional performance, and customer behavior through a complete data analysis workflow.

The project follows four main phases:
1. **Descriptive Analysis** – What happened?  
2. **Diagnostic Analysis** – Why did it happen?  
3. **Predictive Analysis** – What will happen next?  
4. **Prescriptive Analysis** – What should we do about it?
